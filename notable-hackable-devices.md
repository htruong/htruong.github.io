title : "The Big, Growing List of Notable Hackable Devices"

Here I try to maintain a list of consumer devices that are ubiquitous, cheap and have significant hacking values, many accidentally and unintended by the manufacturers. I tried to list all the devices that are still somewhat relevant to 2017 (i.e. still somewhat useful), instead of just being historically interesting.

The advent of custom firmwares have pushed the capabilities and use cases of those devices to far beyond their intended original use, extending their life way beyond their official support lifetime.

If you have suggestions to make this page better, please email to htruong@tnhh.net.


## Laptops

### Acer Chromebook C720 (2013)

This laptop is cheap, runs cool, the battery lasts forever, and it runs every operating system ever. You can flash [coreboot](https://mrchromebox.tech/), an open-source UEFI BIOS for it and it will run Linux, Windows flawlessly, and even macOS. It is also extremely easy to open up. Virtually unbrickable.

### Thinkpad X200 (2009)

For the fans of truly-free BIOS. It runs [libreboot](https://libreboot.org/docs/hcl/x200.html) which has no binary blobs and it seems like the Management Engine can be partially disabled.

### Other notable devices

[Other Thinkpads](https://libreboot.org/docs/hcl/), [Other Chromebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrultrabook/).

## Smartphones and Tablets

### Google Nexus 5 (2013) and Google Nexus 7 (2013)

Supported by many third-party, obscure, crazy mobile OS projects, including Ubuntu Touch, Maru OS, Mobile Plasma. Of course, it is still powerful enough to run the latest version of Android as well.

### HTC HD2 (2009)

It was designed to run Windows Mobile 6 but it runs _everything_. So, if you want a phone that runs _everything_, then get the HD2. It is pre-historic in terms of age in the ever-evolving mobile world, but seems like this phone is the only phone that ages like wine. 

### Other notable devices

Nokia N900, OnePlus One, HP Touchpad, iPhones, Motorola Droid.

## Routers

### Linksys WRT54G (2002)

The router that started it all. It was sued for violating the GPLv2 license. Linksys had to publish the source code for the router, and the rest was history. It is still now being used and trusted by many many people, 15 years after its first release. It can run mesh network, has a huge ham fanbase, and has interchangable antennas. What's not to like?

### Netgear WNDR3800 (2011)

The router that is "just good enough" and "just works" for most people. Runs every pioneering open-source firmwares ever and is still good being a six-year-old device.

## Game Consoles & Handhelds

### Sony PS3 (2006)

The PS3 was advertised as a console that can run Linux, and [could do some serious computing](PlayStation 3 cluster). Then Sony removed the functionality. Then people got mad and added it back again. Then some guy by the name Geohot got sued and [made a video for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iUvuaChDEg). 

### Microsoft Original Xbox (2001)

The Original XBox is a x86 PC in disguise and has [a book dedicated to hacking it](http://hackingthexbox.com/). Even being a 16 year old system, it is probably still one of the best cheap readymade systems that you could buy for retro emulation. The Raspberry Pi is also a good emulation system, except for the cumbersome controller set-up.

### Other notable devices

Sony PSP, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS, Microsoft XBox 360, Microsoft Kinect.

## Development boards

### Expressif ESP8266 (201?)

It is less-than-$5 cheap, it has wifi and it is an Arduino. Now we're talking real values. My memory about this module is murky, but I think it was intended to be a dumb WiFi module initially, but people hacked Nodejs and Arduino later on to make it a microcontroller with WiFi built-in.

### Raspberry Pi 3 (2016)

Tried-and-true device for millions of makers worldwide, the Raspberry Pi 3 is the definite device to have if you want to start hacking. It does everything and runs everything.

### Arduino Uno (2010)

If you want to start with microcontrollers, just start with this one. It has a huge fanbase and developer community, and you could always find a project worth working on with the Arduino.

### Notable devices

Other Arduinos, Teensy, Expressif ESP32, Raspberry Pi Zero.

## Miscleneaous devices

### Eye-Fi SD cards (?)

The small SD-card that runs Linux. It even has [a wiki](http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Eye-Fi) dedicated to hacking it.

### Canon cameras

They have an [open source firmware](http://www.magiclantern.fm) that adds tons of features to the cameras, such as interval shots and finer manual controls. If you have a point-and-shoot, [there is a firmware for it](http://chdk.wikia.com/), too.

### SanDisk Sansa Clip (2007)

It has a SD card slot and runs Rockbox, an open-source firmware that allows your player to play every audio format imaginable. Also, who knows that [your MP3 player can run Doom](https://www.rockbox.org/)? No wireless. More space than a Nomad. Not too lame.
