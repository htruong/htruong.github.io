I am Huan Truong. The joy of discovering and the joy of making are among the forces that keep me going every day. I'm on the way of being a engineer by nature and a scientist by training. In my free time, I am a translator, redditor, HN commentator, CS:GO player, etc: Jack of all trades, master of none.

I'm currently doing my PhD at [Informatics Institute](http://muii.missouri.edu/) [_University of Missouri_](http://www.mizzou.edu/) in Bioinformatics in [Conant's lab](http://web.missouri.edu/~conantg/). I studied in [_Truman State University_](http://www.truman.edu/) and worked briefly there. I also have interned at [_Carnegie Mellon University_](http://www.cmu.edu/) in 2012 and [_The Genome Institute of Singapore_](http://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis) in 2015. In 2013, I had my first paper ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZTuFnawAAAAJ&hl=en)). In 2017 I had my first bug bounty ([Google Bug Bounty](https://bughunter.withgoogle.com/profile/d5f16dfd-6636-4460-ac1b-24d6c9bbb4b2)).
