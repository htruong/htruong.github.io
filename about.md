My name is Huan Truong, the name in Vietnamese is Trương Nguyễn Hữu Huân (hence the web address).

I'm interested in computers, science, cryptography, writings, hardware hacking, translating stuff. I believe science and technology can change lives positively, and am a proponent of Free Software and Open Science. 

Every year, I try to give a short log of what that year has brought me and what got me impressed: [2017](/posts/favorite-things-2017.html).
