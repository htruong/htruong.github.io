My name is Huan Truong, the proper name is Trương NH Huân (hence the web address).

I am a software engineer by trade and have been working for Apple since the end of 2024, as an engineer in the [Cocoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_(API)) team -- specifically, I mainly work on the [TextKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/textkit). Previously, I worked for Tesla for about 6 years.

I currently live in Mountain View, CA with my family, with my beautiful wife, son (born 2021), and daughter (born 2024). Due to shifting priorities, unfortunately, my blogs are mostly abandoned.

I believe science and technology can change lives positively -- I am a proponent of Free Software and Open Science. I think AI stuff is interesting, but stands neutral on its impact.

**Referring**

If you're a student and would like me to refer you to a position at Apple, I would be happy to do so. My email id is `hnt` at the aforementioned company.

Please don't be shy to talk about yourself and what drives you every day *as a person*. To me personally, it's equally important to be technically competent, as having a good drive, and a good heart, and a good story to sell.

Note that for the most part, my referral is probably not going to increase your chance to be accepted.
