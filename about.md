My name is Huan Truong, the proper name is Trương NH Huân (hence the web address).

I believe science and technology can change lives positively -- I am a proponent of Free Software and Open Science. I am also interested in the arts, cultures, languages. I am a giant nerd.

Professionally, my day job is software developer at Tesla.
