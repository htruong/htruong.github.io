I am Huan Truong. The joy of discovering and the joy of making are among the forces that keep me going every day. I'm on the way of being a hacker by nature and a scientist by training.

I'm currently doing my PhD at [Informatics Institute](http://muii.missouri.edu/) [_University of Missouri_](http://www.mizzou.edu/) in Bioinformatics in [Conant's lab](http://web.missouri.edu/~conantg/). I studied in [_Truman State University_](http://www.truman.edu/) and worked briefly there. I also have interned at [_Carnegie Mellon University_](http://www.cmu.edu/) in 2012 and [_The Genome Institute of Singapore_](http://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis) in 2015.
