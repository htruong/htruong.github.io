Vietnamese-related posts. Some are written in Vietnamese.

**Vietnamese Tech Wonders** is a series of blog posts about technological wonders made by Vietnamese people. This series will be written in English, and published on my blog as a category and [maintained on my Github repository](https://github.com/htruong/vietnamese_tech_wonders/). I suspect that part of the reason that some people think that [the world don't know much about the Vietnamese people and its tech industry](https://huyenchip.com/vietnamese/) wasn't because the country lacks talents. I hope that it is because there has been not many people who were willing to document those stories internationally, partly due to being isolated until 1995. So I'm here to blog about amazing stories and hacks by Vietnamese engineers that you might find interesting as a programmer or a tech person, whether you're Vietnamese or otherwise. If you have a story, please feel free to reach out to me, I am constantly looking for wonderful stories to tell.
