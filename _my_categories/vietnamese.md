Vietnamese-related posts. Some are written in Vietnamese.

**Vietnamese Tech Wonders** is a series of blog posts about technological wonders made by Vietnamese people. This series will be written in English, and published on my blog as a category and [maintained on my repository](https://github.com/htruong/vietnamese_tech_wonders/). I suspect that part of the reason that [the world don't much about the Vietnamese people and its tech industry](https://huyenchip.com/vietnamese/) wasn't because we lack talents. It is just because of the sanction that was up until 1995, and then now there aren't many people around who are willing to document those stories. So I'm here to blog about amazing stories and hacks by Vietnamese engineers that you might find interesting as a hacker, whether you're Vietnamese or otherwise. If you have a story, please feel free to reach out.
