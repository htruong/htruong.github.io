title : "Job referring guidelines and FAQs"

Occasionally, I get job referrals requests from friends and aspiring students. I am writing this post as a general guideline for those wishing to get a personal referral from me. This page reflects my policies and experiences, not my employer's. I hope this guide will save you time and awkwardness when you ask me for a personal referral.

As a rule of thumb, the recruiter will ask me if I can personally vouch for the applicant. I'm going to try my best to answer yes to the question if I have any reason to. So:

1. **Are you looking for a software engineer job?** Generally, if I cannot evaluate you as a software engineer, I cannot honestly refer anyone. As a side note, I am generally unable to evaluate works in the field of Machine Learning and Data Analyst. 

2. Answering "yes" to any of the following questions will improve your chance of getting a personal referral email from me to the recruiter/management:

a. Do your projects have anything in common with what I do (System software, Linux)? Have we collaborated before?

b. Do you have experience working on collaborative software projects?

c. Do you have a project that is critically received by the software community? For example, a project that gets on the front page of Hacker News, Slashdot, or Hackaday will do.

d. Do you have a presence online, an interesting portfolio, or research papers?

If your answer is "no," especially when you're a student, please don't be discouraged. You should go ahead and contribute to a Libre software project.

Some good target projects in embedded Linux are OpenWRT and buildroot. If you can port OpenWRT and buildroot to a new device, or if you can write or port a package for them, please go ahead and submit a patch to them. Other than that, I'd think any work on any emulator or niche projects such as Rockbox or Tasmota is highly impressive. As a tip, you should look for an open-source project that is not too big but not the work of a single person. Thus, something "too hard" such as the Linux kernel or GCC, and something "too big" such as Android the OS, are generally things you'd want to avoid when starting out.

I have several projects, one of which is [showmewebcam]("https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam"), and they welcome patches.

Next steps

1. Shorter resumes are better. Please keep your resume in 2 pages or less, do not send your 10-page CV.

2. Please use the company's website. Please don't use LinkedIn job postings.

3. You don't have to let me know that you want to apply for a posting. Please email me personally and we can talk about your relevant experiences after you've applied for the job and include the URL of that job posting. I am personally much less active on LinkedIn and Facebook.

At the end of the day, I hope you the best of luck. I hope this post does not come to you as arrogant, I'm describing a process I know. I hope you have fun at work and life like I do. I hope that you will be my co-worker, and better yet, my boss, one day.

FAQs
--

Here are some of the most common questions that I have received over the years:

1. *Don't you get a bonus when referring me?* I do not get any bonus whatsoever when you get hired.

2. *What if I don't hear anything back?* That means you're not selected. Please don't be discouraged because SV companies are very selective. They have thousands of applicants per day. It's highly likely that they missed you. I have failed many times before.

3. *How did you get hired?* I got hired because of a popular open-source project I started.

4. *Interns ok?* Generally, yes.

Here are some of the more awkward questions, but I think worth mentioning:

1. *I am a Ph.D. student/Postdoc. I am not going to pursue academia.* There are no problems with that. However, you have to be willing to accept that you'll do something different and you will do the job that your employer wants you to do. It's unlikely you'll be hired to continue your doctoral research.

2. *I am working on X, a highly valuable technology. Please let me know how to approach your boss/CEO.* I have no expertise to tell whether your claims are credible. I am a software engineer and not a manager. Please find another way to contact the person.
