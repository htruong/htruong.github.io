## Sunsetting a discussion board

I administered a Vietnamese discussion board that was particularly popular with about 10K members at one point in time. For various reasons that are irrelevant to this post, the participation began to dwindle down since 2012. Now all that is left to the discussion board is a vBulletin 4 installation that has not been actively updated and several bills that keep piling up and about 5 active users on the board.
