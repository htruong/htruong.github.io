title: "Fact Check: Shitty by default"
---


I've just read the Facebook Newsroom PR article titled "[Fact Check: Your Call and SMS History](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/fact-check-your-call-and-sms-history/)." It explains the facts about "we mine your data, but with your permission, you agreed to it yourself, you said it so yourself, man!" thing. And by that, they posted a huge screenshot explaining their side of the story, the opt-in screen:

![Opt the fuck in](/assets/posts-images/fb_horse-shit_screen.png "Proof!")

Do you see any problem with this screenshot? I would know that dialog has two buttons, one is to opt-in, one is to opt-out. But my mom wouldn't know. My dad wouldn't know. My brother wouldn't know.  To 99% of everyone, that dialog has one button.

This is the epitome of "we're shitty by default, but if you know your way around our system, then you're fine."

That's the kind of pattern I've learned to hate, especially being a Vietnamese citizen.

So what the eff does Vietnam has to do with anything here, Walter? I think living in Vietnam felt a lot like that: you're more than fine and life is extremely easy if you know your way around it. In fact, many close friends I know and trust have convinced me to go back. Life is easy, they say. What they don't say is life is easy only when you know your way around the system.

I am 30 now and left to study in the US from that little developing country ten years ago. When I left, I was a young 19-year-old college drop-out working for a software trading startup company. One day I got stopped for "passing the red light" among a stream of people in the rush hour (and I didn't think I did!). Anyway, the police officer threatened to tow my scooter and confiscate my driver's license. He asked where I work. I told him I work for a software company, which was a huge mistake. One way around that, he suggested, was to pay him $25 and everything would be fine and he would let me go. So I did. I then called my mom, and she said I've been ripped off -- the normal price was $5 at most! $25 was a week's worth of salary for most people. I was not happy about that, so I went to the office looking a bit off. My boss was an extremely intricate guy, and he immediately noticed that. He invited me to go for a coffee break. I explained to him what happened. He said: "Look, Bee (my nickname), what does the police officer want? Did he actually want to tow your scooter? No! It takes space in their towing vehicle, he doesn't get paid for towing your scooter away. He had to take time to load your scooter on the truck, which can be used to fine another person. He just wanted to threaten to make you pay. So always look for the intention, and then negotiate until both of you are happy." I remember that lesson for life. Whenever I come back to that country, I still got stopped by the police for traffic rule violations -- for the record, I did not receive a single citation in the US for the past 6 years being a driver, but I got it every time I traveled back to Vietnam. But as I knew my way to dance around their expectation: I would be a poor student, I would run out of cash, I would come from the countryside shipping packages and don't know the rules in the city, whatever to ask for that $5 price. I knew the last thing they wanted to do was to tow my scooter. There are surprises I learned every day there, but as I am not strapped on cash as I was before anymore, so paying for university of life isn't a big of a deal to me anymore. And I know my friends in the country feel that way too: They are now matured, have money and education, life is easy. Life just ain't when you deal with new stuff you don't know how to dance around.

But that is one thing I knew I hate about that socialist-by-name society: It's provides you with choices against you by default. When I moved to the US, I learned people don't necessarily have to act that way. That was a huge relief for me, given [I am genetically not good at predicting people's intentions](/posts/personal-genetics-and-me.html). But I am worried that the US is moving towards that way, first in the virtual space. And in the past few years, I think the tide is moving towards real life too. People are given the shitty defaults with stuff that fucks with them. Unless! Unless you do dodgy stuff you aren't comfortable with. Unless you know how to dance that dance to push the right button, to say the right magic words.

I think that "unless" is very important. It separates good people with bad people, and people that make the world better and the people who make the world bend over for their interests. That "fact check" sorry piece of PR is no more than the shitty society that exploits their own citizens, and drown the people who with less knowledge and experience who need to float the most. I wouldn't want to dance around that shit if I had a choice, even when I knew how to dance around that shit.

But that's just me.
