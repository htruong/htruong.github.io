title: 'GNU/Linux, honestly, why?'
---
Recently someone contacted me to ask why should they use GNU/Linux. So I replied below, and reposting it with the hope that someone out there will find it useful.

>I am a Linux user for almost a decade now and what I can say is it's a way of thinking - 
a way of seeing life. Using Chrome OS or Windows is like going to a 
restaurant vs Linux is like learning to cook. Using Chrome OS or Windows is 
like going to IKEA to buy a table and Linux is like doing the woodwork 
yourself. Either way will get most people delicious meals and nice 
furniture that does the job well enough. With the latter though, some 
people also find the joy of being able to craft exactly what they like. 
Some people like to cook, some people like doing woodwork, and some people 
like using Linux. It might come with many frustrations at first, and it is 
definitely not for the faint of hearts. But, if you love to understand how 
computers work and why they are fun, Linux is an excellent starting point 
of what you want to start exploring. The experiences from using Linux might 
also be able to give you some insights on some of the modern issues 
regarding privacy, security, intellectual properties, and personal freedom.

>1, Linux is not for everyone, just like 
cooking and woodworking is not for everyone. There is nothing you can't do 
with Windows, you don't need Linux to do anything. Most things you want to 
do will be even easier or more intuitive with Windows because it has an 
excellent commercial software support. But if you are willing to learn 
about computers, you will find Linux much more interesting.

>2, Having a 
device that is made to work with Linux, instead of buying a random laptop 
and hoping it will work with Linux, will save you lots of troubles. The 
Chromebook for Linux is a good start because Chrome OS is essentially a 
very specialized version of Linux. You can download a more general-purpose 
version, such as GalliumOS and it will just work with your Chromebook 
without any hardware compatibility issues.

>I need many, 
many more words to answer you this question fully, but those are the "big 
picture" I can give you about it. :) Hope it helps!
