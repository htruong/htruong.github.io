title: "Shoving an Arduino into a pillow"
---

Yesterday my friend sent me a link to [a giant Enter button](https://bluecrate.com/products/giant-enter-button) that sells for $18. He probably saw it on Facebook or something and thought I would find it funny. I thought the price was reasonable and it makes a good gag gift. Since I've just watched [a video about how many things that seem original are actually made in China](https://youtu.be/RDd10-poMm8?t=845), I wonder whether this is an original idea. So after 5 minutes of searching, I found the same product on [Alibaba](https://m.alibaba.com/product/60704020208/Factory-supply-giant-enter-button-for.html) for as low as $3 and as high as $5.

Let's put the min-order aside for a minute, what's interesting to me was:

1. Despite the higher price, the reseller does not ship from the US. They ship it from China too, probably by drop shipping. You're not getting it any faster by paying >4x more.

2. The original product was not advertised as just a useless novelty product. It has a function - office workers in countries with warmer climates often take _siestas_ by napping in office for 30 minutes after lunch. This is a makeshift pillow with a half-assed effort to disguise as a fun office item. 

So the added-value for the product the reseller did here is to advertise it as a product that does _less_. And perhaps, they had two white guys posing with a Mac instead of an Asian lady posing with a PC for the product -- it appears more fun. And it isn't sold on a Chinese wholesale website.

So I imagine the conversation in Shenzhen where it was created probably went something like this:

- Check this out, this Arduino microcontroller is totally cool, the chip costs a quarter each. It even has native USB. We can do a ton of cool stuff with it.
- What can we do with it?
- IoT something, I don't know. Perhaps we can ask Jenny, she is often full of ideas.
- She's taking a siesta though. Look, she's using a black brick as a pillow or what? I used to wonder what the heck she had that black block on her desk for... 
- I have an idea, shove it with a tweeter speaker to her pillow, so we can prank her when she's napping!
- I have an even better one. Shove it to her pillow and disguise it as an office item, like a keyboard or something, no one wants to see a pillow on your desk.
- That's brilliant. I'm gonna make it double as a giant dedicated Enter key, let me code it up.

[10 minutes later. Jenny woke up.]

- Jenny, can I borrow your pillow for a minute?
- What for?
- I need to shove an Arduino into your pillow.

[15 minutes later.]

- Here Jenny, your pillow also doubles as an Enter key now. We should manufacture this.
- Why do you think that it is a g--... So, it's a pillow and a keyboard. How do we price it?
- The electronics is 0.75. The pillow is 0.5. Assembly is like 0.5. Add our profit on it. 
- That sounds great. I'll make sure that we're able to manufacture the first batch tomorrow.
- Cool. By the way, can you pose for the product pictures real quick...?

The conversation at the place that resells it probably went like this:

- Hey Tommy, check this giant button out, let's buy this for James' birthday next month. He's a mech keyboard nut.
- That's hilarious! Let's buy it -- by the way, I'd share the cost with you.
- Don't bother, it's 5 bucks. But wait, we have to buy 20 of them. What do we do with the rest?
- It's so cheap, I don't care, just give one to everyone in the office. I'd pay 20 for one even.
- Chad, come look, we think we are gonna buy this for everyone in the office. This giant button is like 5 bucks. It's hilarious.

[Chad the manager came and look. 5 minutes later...]

- Hey Diane, can you add this to our product catalog, also can you create a new advertisement campaign for this as a gag gift? Just don't mention anything about the anti-stress pillow crap. Remember to negotiate a good drop shipping price before you put it online. Also â€“ Justin, how much did you say you're willing to pay?
- 20.
- OK. Diane, make it 17.99 so it doesn't start with 2. Can you guys help Diane with some funny poses?
