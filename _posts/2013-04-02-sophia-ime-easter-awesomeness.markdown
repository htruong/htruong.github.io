I recently wrote a Vietnamese keyboard driver during the week I’m off
for Easter.

The idea with that keyboard is that one doesn’t have to type the
annoying Vietnamese accents when they type Vietnamese anymore, just type
as if they are typing English and the software will be smart enough to
‘guess’ what they want to say.

The app is called [Sophia (click here to get
it)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.htruong.inputmethod.latin)
(for wisdom) and it’s pretty badass. I think it gets most of what I want
to say right.

It’s overwhelmed with positive reviews and raves 24 hours after release.

This is really crazily great. Words can’t describe how excited I am now.
