title: Things I wish I knew about programming and becoming a professional programmer
---
I started writing code since I had my first computer when I was 13 years old. Little did I know I am still doing it 15 years later. Here at 30, those are the things that I wish I knew.

**Writing**: Most people won't read my code, but many people want to know what my code does. I should spend more time writing to explain what I want to get done **and why**, rather than throwing the code out there or explaining what's so clever about the code. Having the repository and publishing the code doesn't mean shit if no one knows what it does.

**Blogosphere and Facebook**: Writing on Facebook means that no one will be able to discover it after the first 24 hours being published in that walled garden. The practical implication is that my posts on Facebook get **much** less exposure than a traditional blog, even on the first glance, it does not look like so. Likes, reactions, comments, and other Facebook "features" are distractions - it gave me the impression that Facebook is the better platform to publish. It wasn't. Writing on a blog sounds like a less rewarding experience, but it turns out to be a good investment in the long run. 

**Designing for maintenance**: Most people don't care about my projects, so I better churn things out as fast as I can. Pretending it is a 1000-people project when really it's just me working on the project is a waste of time. In general, I don't know ahead of time what will be a popular project.

**The value of code**: My code on GitHub is like art projects on DeviantArt or Behance, it ain't worth shit. Copy it, I don't care. I was more than once approached by people who thinks that the *idea* of their hypothetical startup is a trade secret. I have a startup idea: Being a Facebook competitor. That idea is literally worth $100B. Do it. I give out ideas for free.

**Maintaining a project**: It is important to commit to maintaining what I created.

**Impostor syndrome**: I don't really know how to code and that is OK.

**The 3 AM rule**: If I am willing to stay up until 3 AM to do something then I really like it. If I am not, then whatever it is, I don't like it enough. *Doing what I like has so much more potentials than doing what I think is noble.* 

**Networking**: Not my thing, I just give up pretending that I'm comfortabe with face-to-face meetings and introducing myself to people at places -- I hate it. But I can send emails to people. To me, emailing is the best way to know and communicate with people.

**Being consistent**: Writing code and getting things done is like depositing money in the bank. Being consistent is much more important than being clever or heroic.

**Developing a taste**: Humiliating other people is never a good idea. However, to me, it is easy to say some uplifting bullshit about just anything. Having a taste on what's good, the style I appreciate, and having meaningful feedback is harder. I feel the education system in the USA tends to favor the uplifting bullshit feels good approach -- and now I found out that it is not my style.

All in all, I found out that many people will perceive that programmers are smart, weird, and clumsy in social settings. Most of it turns out to be quite true for me and it is easy to be let down by real life issues. For me, what helped the most was to ignore the flops and burying my head in the sand. It is always important to keep going with a big warm heart, keep smiling, and be optimistic.
