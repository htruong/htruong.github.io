title: Things I learned being a programmer for 15 years
---
I started writing code since I had my first computer when I was 13 years old. Little did I know I am still doing it 15 years later. Here at 30, those are the things that I learned.

**Writing**: Most people won't read my code, but many people want to know what my code does. I should spend more time writing to explain what I want to get done **and why**, rather than throwing the code out there or explaining what's so clever about the code. Having the repository and publishing the code doesn't mean shit if no one knows what it does.

**Blogosphere and Facebook**: Writing on Facebook means that no one will be able to discover it after the first 24 hours being published in that walled garden. The practical implication is that my posts on Facebook get **much** less exposure than a traditional blog, even on the first glance, it does not look like so. Likes, reactions, comments, and other Facebook "features" are distractions - it gave me the impression that Facebook is the better platform to publish. It is not: Writing on a blog sounds like a less rewarding experience, but it is a good investment in the long run.

**Designing for maintenance**: Most people don't care about my projects, so I better churn things out as fast as I can. Pretending it is a 1000-people project when really it's just me working on the project and set up complicated mantenance rules is a waste of time. I don't need "Signed-off by Jimmy <jimmies_rustled@aol.com>" in every git commit in my blog. In general, I don't know ahead of time what will be a popular project, so I tend to start my projects with rather hacky organization.

**The value of code**: My code on GitHub is like art projects on DeviantArt or Behance, it ain't worth shit. Copy it, I don't care. I was more than once approached by people who think that the *idea* of their hypothetical startup is a trade secret. Sign a non-disclosure statement before I tell you. 

How about this: I have a stealth startup idee, just be a Facebook competitor. That idea is literally worth $100B. Do it. I give out ideas for free. No NDA required.

**Maintaining a project**: It is important to commit to maintaining what I created.

**Impostor syndrome**: I don't really know how to code and that is OK.

**The 3 AM rule**: If I am willing to stay up until 3 AM to do something then I really like it. If I am not, then whatever it is, I don't like it enough. *Doing what I like has so much more potentials than doing what I think is noble.* 

**Networking**: Not my thing, I just give up pretending that I'm comfortabe with face-to-face meetings and introducing myself to people at places -- I hate it. But I can send emails to people. To me, emailing is the best way to know and communicate with people.

**Being consistent**: Writing code and getting things done is like depositing money in the bank. Being consistent is much more important than being clever or heroic.

**Developing a taste**: Undermining other people's ideas is not a wise decision. However, to me, it is easy to say some uplifting bullshit about just anything. Having a taste on what is good, the style I appreciate, and having meaningful feedback is harder. I feel the education system in the USA tends to favor the "feels good" approach -- and now I found out that it is not my style.

All in all, I found out that many people will perceive that programmers are smart, weird, and clumsy in social settings. Most of it turns out to be quite true for me -- but being smart doesn't mean that people like me being a smarty pants, which I do a lot -- it is easy to be let down by real life issues. There will be flops -- and a lot of embarassing moments. For me, what helped the most was to ignore the flops and burying my head in the sand and keep going. It is always important to keep going with a big warm heart, a smile, and be optimistic. And that is not easy.
