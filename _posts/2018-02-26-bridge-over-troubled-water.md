title: Bridge over troubled water
---

Maybe you're reading this because you stumbled upon some of my recent projects or blog posts that got really popular for one reason or another. I was fortunate to be able to strike some of the right notes for many hackers with my recent semi-interesting blog posts about Google, or my Raspberry Pi-related projects. Or other reasons, I don't know. In the last month, I made it to Hacker News, Reddit, and Slashdot front page. I guess one of my bucket list items is to make it to Slashdot (although Slashdot isn't as big of a deal like it once was, it was mainly nostalgia). So life mission accomplished.

But all of that is just the tip of the iceberg. I haven't been able to accomplish much for the last two years, just scraping by. I felt guilty as hell about it, because my advisor in grad school is the greatest person I knew in life whom I would always look up to and I don't want him to be disappointed.  But real life is messy. Instead of writing papers, I watched Youtube videos all day long: Be them pointless Red Alert 3 matches, or semi-funny Angry Video Game Nerd episodes, or semi-informative 8-bit guy videos. Or maybe I would listen to a podcast [about an antique clock restorer's biography](https://stownpodcast.org). Whatever that is, it was all consumption and not much creativity. I couldn't bring myself to sit in front of the computer and program and write. Maybe it was the family fallout with my older brother, maybe it was the sudden breakup I had last year, maybe it was because of President Donald Trump? I don't know. Whatever the reason was, the end result was the same. I didn't get shit done. I feel I was the beast that got left behind, that my glorious days of being the capable, optimistic, affectionate person were long gone. I self-diagnosed myself with depression, for no particular reason. I'd like to think it was because of Donald Trump, but I think it was more of a distraction than it was the reason. In any case, it was easier on myself when I blame others for my failure to be whom I wanted to be.

Back in Missouri, I lived in a house with 7 other (unrelated) grad students who rented a house individually from an eccentric 65-year-old or so landlord named Rob. Rob offered a good rate for his 8-bedroom shared house in Columbia, a central Missourian town, sandwiched between St. Louis and Kansas City. No, it wasn't just a good rate, it was cheap. You would think that life would be chaotic, but for the most part, everyone was quiet, respectful, and mostly kept it for themselves. Occasionally, I would go out have a drink with my favorite roommates, or listen to them playing flute and guitar at night at the front porch.

_When you have 7 roommates, you're sure to be able to find several people you could enjoy the company of (and vice-versa)._

But despite all that, everyone seemed to enjoy life, except for me. I would lay on my bed, look out of my window and see the lights coming down to the leaves of the tree, and shined on the creaky old wooden floor, all the same, every day. I would see my beautiful betta fish and goldfish, gifts of [Dr. Avi Karn](http://avikarn.com) - my old roommate, swimming happily in their little fish tanks enjoying the sunlight from the window, worrying about nothing in life. At the end of the month, I would go deposit 20% of my earning to Rob, and he was always happy about that. Rob would try to talk to me for hours on end about his life and business adventures and how Donald Trump was going to be the best president ever (fortunately, I enjoyed listening to him).

Then, for reasons that are not relevant here, I moved following my advisor's move to Raleigh, NC. When I moved, I tried to give my goldfish to Quyen, but we put him in a temporary container, and it was too small, he suffocated and he died the next morning. My move felt pretty much like the goldfish. I moved on right before my 30th birthday, and celebrated it with no fanfare with Yue - my only friend there, and no real party.

_Myself the last day in Missouri._

I decided live alone in an expensive, spacious, nice apartment. Being 30 year old (or being in 2018), I realized a hard truth that human connections in real life are very hard to come by. Everyone has their priorities straight at this point: either it is for their career, their publications, their money, their love life, their family, their good health. I haven't gotten things figured out for myself yet. Life is like an endless loop that happens one day after another, I might as well end it and I wouldn't miss out much. But I didn't die. Every day I would wake up. It's like Groundhog day -- a little bit cruel comedy, perhaps. What once felt like having the most useful skill in this world - being able to tell a computer what I want to do, quickly, turned out to be a wrestling with moral. Why is Facebook so shitty and predatory? Why am I receiving all the ads at all times? Why the fuck does everything have to make money under the disguise of making my life better and "connect people" and shit?

Everyone was moving on to the next big thing: AI, ML, startups, apps, image recognition, statistics, containers, blockchains, Kurbernette or whatever the fuck it's called. The other day I sat next to a guy on a plane to Hanoi in economy class (I think among the cheapest tickets on a plane) and noticed he was reading a paper and played with his terminal the whole time. When the plane landed, we exchanged some information and now he earned his Ph.D. and turned out to be one of the most successful Ethereum developers, having a startup worth half a billion dollars. Yet I was here with those stupid microcontrollers, GPUs, C code, and DNA sequences. And struggling to graduate. My parents came to help for a couple of months, and that was appreciated. I am glad that we had a good time, I felt loved, and I think they did too, but that didn't help how I felt about myself. 

I tried to talk to one of my exes. I was so glad she didn't do well and she just broke up with her then-boyfriend. She said to me "You are a psychopath. I think you should go to a mental hospital to get help." It was a slap in the face, but I agreed that she was totally right. And then Raleigh really happened. Living by myself with no entertainment, I tried desperately to make something happen just to keep myself from being bored to death. I tried to get into a relationship with someone even I didn't like her that much. She politely refused. The other day, being so bored, I stayed up until 7 am watching a soccer match of the Vietnamese national team, and then I made a posted under my alternative nickname in a big Vietnamese-centric forum. It turned out to be the most favorite post in its history ever and was reshared on Facebook and gathered a staggering amount of shares and reactions. Perhaps more surprisingly, I received comments such as "Well written. I tried to not cry, but I couldn't." and "Who is chopping onions?" when people read what I had to say. That was the a-ha moment when I realized that perhaps my life was miserable, but that didn't stop me from telling good stories. That was the moment the [Taxi Driver](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075314/), who tried to die a villain, just survived to see himself a hero.

Then I figured I could make an informative but with a clickbait title about Google Maps. It worked and gathered some attention. And then someone, who bothered to dig through my incoherent musings on the blog, thought that I wrote something funny about Google Hangouts, and they shared it too. And suddenly people contacted me about my blog. Some were just notes such as "I like your blog, do you have an RSS feed so I can subscribe to?" but that simple note meant the world to me. I thought I was writing for myself all along, no one cared, but there is that stranger halfway around the world reading this. I have been receiving some job offers and tips. Although none really went anywhere, I just couldn't believe how kind everyone was to me. 

In the last couple of weeks, I have been working hard on projects and ideas that I have been wanting to get done for a long time. Some of them made the splash and was well received. I for once very glad for the positive reactions for [EzPi4ME](https://github.com/htruong/ezpi4me) and especially [Crankshaft](http://getcrankshaft.com). I received more likes and stars in two weeks on my little project more than I accumulated in the past 5 years. Yesterday, I was filming the driving demonstration with my voice trembling because it was 1 PM and I have been working on the website and its first release for pretty much the whole weekend. I haven't eaten anything for the whole day. I filmed myself going to Subway, because that was the first thing that came to mind, and it is the closest place. After eating the Subway, and a couple of more hours tweaking things, my head hurt like it never did before. I tried to go to bed but couldn't sleep. But I was so glad I spent all that efforts for this hobbyist project. For the first time in a long while, I felt there was some hope.

My hope is that Crankshaft will be a great project. I have some time to develop it now (I don't have money, but I think I will figure it out soon). Foremost, Crankshaft is what I want to see myself to be - fun, useful and is a joy to know. That is how I want to see more of myself and the world. And I think I have some power to shape it, however small, every day. In the next days or so I will work on my thesis code, figure out how to get a phone I can debug Crankshaft with. All thanks to the little emails and comments I receive from people. It was the bridge over troubled water.

Maybe I was the sole bitter psychopath, lonely, crazy person in this world. I'm glad if you are happier person than I am. But if in case you're not and feeling the way I did, don't give up hope and creativity. I think all is well.
