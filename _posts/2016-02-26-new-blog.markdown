I'm finally migrating my blog to Jekyll and github pages. As my previous setup -- oryza -- was inspired by jekyll, so the move wasn't horrible and only took a day. I now don't depend on my raspberry pi/oryza daemon working correctly all the times anymore, which is a good thing.

I also have an amp version of each blog post. Send me an email if you find  breakages.

I am also planning to blog more often, so stay tuned for future updates.
